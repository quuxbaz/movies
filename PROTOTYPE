(*) Start here

If you'd like to understand the system, perhaps you could begin with
the data provider API.

  http://developer.tmsapi.com/docs/read/data_v1_1/movies

(*) To understand the code

Begin at movies.rkt.  The database is in model.rkt.  The API handler
is tmsapi.rkt.  ``TMS'' is the name of the data provider.  TMS
provides movie data for the entire United States and Canada.  (TMS is
now called Gracenote.)

(*) The frontend

The frontend is written with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  The main
library is angular, but watch out: this is angular version 1.0.

(*) Demonstration 

For a demonstration, say 

  make demo

to your shell.  Then use the --demo flag as in 

  racket movies.rkt --demo

That's all.

The demonstration shows a few threaters of the city of Toledo, Ohio.

(*) How to run the system in production

Do you have an API key?  You'll need one.  Assuming you do, for
production mode, say --production --key apikey to movies.rkt.  In
other words,

  racket movies.rkt --key my-api-key --production

That's all.
